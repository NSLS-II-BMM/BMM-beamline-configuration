At the top of the big screen, you see a crude-but-handy beamline monitor.&nbsp; It looks like this:

This provides a (very) concise overview of the state of the beamline.

'''Line 1'''

*BMM is enabled (green) or disable (red) 
*The BM, FE, & user photon shutters are open (green) or closed (red) 
*The ring current 
*The state of vacuum sections 1 through 7 -- green means vaccum level is OK, red means vacuum level is high 
*The state of the in-vacuum motors, 4 on the DCM, 2 on the focusing mirror, 2 on the harmonic rejection mirror -- green means temperature is cool, red means temperature is high 
*The open (green) or closed (red) state of the 3 front end gate valves and the 6 beamline gate valves 

'''Line 2'''

*The energy position of the monochromator 
*The edge for which the beamline has been configured 
*The signals on the I0 and It ion chambers, measured in nanoamps 
*The current operation at the beamline, options are: idle (white), XAFS scan (pink), line scan (cyan), area scan (yellow), or time scan (blue). Estimate times will be displayed 

'''Line 3'''
<ul style="margin-left: 40px;">
<li>Positions of common sample motors and size of sample slits</li>
<li>The reference foil in use</li>
<li>The bit that look like this <code><kbd>| -&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; |</kbd></code> is a sort of heartbeat monitor verifying that the dashboard is running</li>
</ul>

== Running cadashboard and screen placement ==

#Launch an xterm by typing <code>xterm -title CAdashboard</code> at any command line or by hitting <kbd>Alt-F2</kbd> and typing <code>xterm -title CAdashboard</code>. 
#Do <code>run-cadashboard</code>. 
#Resize the xterm and move it where you want it. 
#Right click on the frame, select <tt>More actions</tt>, then <tt>Keep above others</tt>. 
#It is handy to remove the window from the taskbar.&nbsp; This can be done by right click on the fram, then <tt>More actions</tt>, then <tt>Special window settings</tt>. Click <tt>OK</tt> in the info dialog. In the "Window specific settings" dialog click on the "Arrangement and Access tab", enable <tt>Skip taskbar</tt> with arguments <tt>Apply now </tt>and <tt>Yes</tt>. 

<code>cadashboard</code> has a mode for XRD using the goniometer.&nbsp; At step 2, run <code>cadashboard xrd</code>, that is, explicitly provide the "xrd" argument to the program.
