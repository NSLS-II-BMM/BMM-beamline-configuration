==May 5, 2023: Failure of the DM3_BCT axis==

'''Symptoms''': BCT could not be moved from CSS or bsui.  Immediate encoder loss.  No motion.

After several times restarting the IOC and one power cycle of the motor controller, I finally thought to take a look at the physical device.  This is what I found.

'''Solution''': Rethread lead screw through upper carriage.  Reinsert into coupler.  Tighten coupler.
