BMM experimental calendar: [https://www.bnl.gov/ps/beamlines/schedule.php?q=6-BM https://www.bnl.gov/ps/beamlines/schedule.php?q=6-BM] &nbsp; ([[Media:Schedule-2020-1.pdf|2020-1 Schedule as PDF]])

= Register for BNL Site Access =

Upon receipt of notification of your beamtime, please verify that all the team members attending your experiment have a valid BNL Guest registration. New registration requests as well as the extensions requests for expired registrations shall be submitted as soon as possible. Approvals for guest registrations can take as long as two months for some non-US citizens.

To apply for a BNL Guest appointment: [https://www.bnl.gov/ps/userguide/beforearrival.php https://www.bnl.gov/ps/userguide/beforearrival.php]

= BNL Domain Account =

When your BNL Guest registration becomes active, you should receive an email with instructions for enabling your BNL domain account. You must complete that step, which includes setting your password and signing up for DUO Federal two-factor authentication. If you need to request an account, go to [https://www.bnl.gov/accounts/ https://www.bnl.gov/accounts/] and click the button that says "Submit account registration form".

Enabling your BNL account is '''non-option''''''al'''. You '''<span style="color:#e74c3c">must</span>''' have an active account in order to unlock the computers at the beamline. Without an active account, a known password, and DUO Federal two=-factor authenticaion, <span style="background-color:#ffff33">you will be unable to perform your experiment</span>.

= Safety Approval Form =

Submit your Safety Approval Form (SAF) '''AT LEAST''' four weeks before the above starting date. Your SAF should provide a complete and accurate description of the experiment, including all '''samples, chemicals, solvents, reference materials, and equipment '''that will be used during the experiment and preparation. In addition, any additional equipment not provided by the beamline has to be identified and described in the SAF. Provide detailed information on sample processing and any safety measures necessary.

'''Failure to submit a complete SAF in a timely fashion may result in a loss of beamtime.'''

To submit a SAF: [https://pass.bnl.gov https://pass.bnl.gov]

If your experiment requires chemicals, compressed gases, lab access, or other equipment, please contact Bruce Ravel ([mailto:bravel@bnl.gov bravel@bnl.gov]) well ahead of your expriment. Transportation of hazardous materials related to your experiment to the BNL site and back to the home institution is '''your''' responsibility.

= Support Laboratories =

Currently, three labs support user activities at BMM.&nbsp; They are:

*[https://www.bnl.gov/ps/labs/index.php?scroll=3-LL06 Lab 3L-L06: XAS Sample Prep Lab] 
*[https://www.bnl.gov/ps/labs/index.php?scroll=3-LL07 Lab 3L-L07: Environmental Science Wet Lab] 
*[https://www.bnl.gov/ps/labs/index.php?scroll=3-LL09 Lab 3L-L09: XAS Chemistry Lab] 

If you prepare or treat samples on-site, please include the request for the use of NSLS-II User Laboratories ([https://www.bnl.gov/ps/labs/ https://www.bnl.gov/ps/labs/]) in your Safety Approval Form. Here is some advice on selecting the correct lab:

#'''Unbound nanoparticles''': Please note that supported nanoparticles or nanoparticles in solution are ''not'' considered “unbound”. If your samples are indeed ''unbound'', please contact BMM beamline scientist Bruce Ravel ([mailto:bravel@bnl.gov bravel@bnl.gov]) as soon as possible. 
#'''Solid sample preparation (pellet pressing, spreading on tape etc)''':&nbsp; Request Lab 3L-L06. 
#'''Liquid samples (organic solvents, acids, bases)''': Request Lab 3L-L09. 
#'''Hydrofluoric acid treatment''': Request Lab 3L-L09 and notify Cognizant Space Manager, Syed Khalid at [mailto:khalid@bnl.gov khalid@bnl.gov], as soon as possible. 
#'''Environment and earth science sample preparation and treatment''': Request Lab 3L-L07. 

Requests for using gloveboxes should be discussed prior to submitting the SAF, with Bruce Ravel ([mailto:bravel@bnl.gov bravel@bnl.gov]) and/or Syed Khalid ([mailto:khalid@bnl.gov khalid@bnl.gov])

'''<span style="background-color:#FFFF00">Please note:&nbsp;</span>'''<span style="background-color:#FFFF00">Each lab you select on your safety approval form makes work for the lab stewards. Only request the lab(s) that you actually intend to use.</span>

= Training =

Please complete all required online user training at least one week before the starting date. Failure to complete training may result in a delay starting your experiment.

To complete your training, follow the training instructions at: [https://www.bnl.gov/ps/userguide/beforearrival.php https://www.bnl.gov/ps/userguide/beforearrival.php]

= Electrical Equipment =

Any equipment with an electrical cable including low-voltage instruments and samples are considered electrical equipment (laptop computers are excluded). If you plan to bring electrical equipment for your experiment, please contact Jerome Malley, Electrical Equipment Inspection (EEI) Manager at [mailto:malley@bnl.gov malley@bnl.gov] as soon as practical and at least two weeks before the start of your experiment. Be prepared to provide manuals, photos, electrical diagrams, and schematics. Please include beamline staff (Bruce Ravel <[mailto:bravel@bnl.gov bravel@bnl.gov]> for all experiments & Jean Jordan-Sweet <[mailto:jlj@bnl.gov jlj@bnl.gov]> for XRD experiments) in your communication as some pre-approved electrical equipment (e.g., potentiostat, heaters, temperature meters, and controllers) may be available at the beamline.

= Research Equipment Pool =

Many experimental tools are available from the NSLS-II [https://public.bnl.gov/sites/rep/SitePages/Home.aspx Research Equipment Pool]. If you wish to use any items from equipment pool, contact Bruce Ravel ([mailto:bravel@bnl.gov bravel@bnl.gov]) well ahead of your experiment.

= Shipping things to the beamline =

Things can be shipped to
<pre style="margin-left: 40px">Bruce Ravel / Beamline 6BM
Buidling 740
Brookhaven National Laboratory
Upton NY 11973</pre>

= The Day of your Experiment =

Unless told otherwise, <span style="color:#FF0000">your experiment starts at 8 am.</span>&nbsp; You should consider having all team members arrive the afternoon prior to the first day of the beamtime to check in at the GUV Center ([https://www.bnl.gov/guv/ https://www.bnl.gov/guv/]) and to complete beamline specific training.

Please consult NSLS-II user guide ([http://url https://www.bnl.gov/ps/userguide/]) or contact BMM beamline staff for more information.
