= Recovering from a Power Outage =


== Computers, motor controllers ==

#Verify that <tt>xf06bm-ws1</tt>, <tt>xf06bm-ws2</tt>, <tt>xf06bm-ws4, xf06bm-ws5, xf06bm_disp1&nbsp;</tt> have all rebooted 
#Verify that&nbsp;<tt>xf06bm-ioc1</tt> and xf06bm-ioc2 are on the network 
#Verify that the VME crate is powered up and on the network (try pinging 10.6.128.21) 
#Verify that the quad (Siddons, black-box) electrometers are powered up and on the network (try pinging <tt>xf06bm-em1</tt> and <tt>xf06bm-em2</tt>) 
#Verify that the motor controllers are powered up and on the network (try pinging <tt>xf06bm-mc01</tt>, <tt>xf06bm-mc02</tt>, and so on, through 14) 
#Log onto&nbsp;<tt>xf06bm-ws3</tt> as xf06bm and start up <code>bsui</code>.

== Homing and recovering motor positions ==

Note the confusing and inconsistent use of dots and underscores in the following commands!

#Do <code>RE(dcm.recover())</code> -- home and recover positions of DCM motors (defined in <code>20-dcm.py</code>)
#Do <code>RE(recover_slits2())</code> -- home and recover positions of slits in diagnostic module 2 (defined in <code>15-slits.py</code>)
#Do <code>RE(recover_slits3())</code> -- home and recover positions of slits in diagnostic module 3 (defined in <code>15-slits.py</code>)
#Do <code>RE(recover_mirrors())</code> -- home and recover positions of lateral and vertical motors in M2 and M3 (defined in <code>73-plans.py</code>)
#Do <code>RE(recover_screens())</code> -- home and recover positions of <tt>dm2_fs</tt>, <tt>dm3_fs</tt>, and <tt>dm3_bct</tt> (defined in <code>73-plans.py</code>)

At the end of all of this, you should be at 7148 eV and in photon delivery mode E.&nbsp; There should be light in the end station, although you will need to do a <code>RE(change_edge())</code> command to fully optimize the beamline.

== No need to home ==

The following motors are not normally used in operations at BMM:

#dm3_bpm
#dm3_foils
#dm1_filters1
#dm1_filters2

== Do not home! ==

Homing the M1 motors is a can of worms. I strongly recommend against doing so.&nbsp; The M2 bender does not really get homed.&nbsp; Simply return it to its lower limit and call that 0.

#any motor on M1
#m2_bender
