= New System - DIODE =

The new kill switch system uses DIODE to close the kill switch circuit. Two-conductor cable is run from each motor controller to a remote DIODE box mounted on the inboard wall of the end station.

The Bluesky interface is defined here: [https://github.com/NSLS-II-BMM/profile_collection/blob/master/startup/BMM/killswitch.py https://github.com/NSLS-II-BMM/profile_collection/blob/master/startup/BMM/killswitch.py]

From the docstring of the class:
<pre>A simple interface to the DIODE kill switches for the Phytron
amplifiers on the FMBO Delta Tau motor controllers.

In the BMM DIODE box, these are implemented on channels 0 to 4 of
slot 4.

attributes
----------
dcm 
   kill switch for MC02, monochromator
slits2
   kill switch for MC03, DM2 slits
m2
   kill switch for MC04, focusing mirror
m3
   kill switch for MC05, harmonic rejection mirror
dm3
   kill switch for MC06, hutch slits and diagnostics

methods
-------
kill(mc)
   disable Phytron
enable(mc)
   activate Phytron
cycle(mc)
   disable, wait 5 seconds, reactivate, then re-enable all motors

Specify the motor controller as a string, i.e. 'dcm', 'slits2', 'm2', 'm3', 'dm3'

Here is a common problem which is resolved using a kill switch.

      BMM E.111 [36] ▶ RE(mvr(m2.pitch, 0.05))
      INFO:BMM_logger:    Moving m2_pitch to 2.550

      Moving m2_pitch to 2.550
      ERROR:ophyd.objects:Motion failed: m2_yu is in an alarm state status=AlarmStatus.STATE severity=AlarmSeverity.MAJOR
      ERROR:ophyd.objects:Motion failed: m2_yu is in an alarm state status=AlarmStatus.STATE severity=AlarmSeverity.MAJOR
      ERROR:ophyd.objects:Motion failed: m2_ydi is in an alarm state status=AlarmStatus.STATE severity=AlarmSeverity.MAJOR
      ERROR:ophyd.objects:Motion failed: m2_ydi is in an alarm state status=AlarmStatus.STATE severity=AlarmSeverity.MAJOR
      Out[36]: ()

This is telling you that the amplifiers for two of the M2 jacks
went into an alarm state. In the vast majority of cases, this
simply requires killing and reactivating those amplifiers.

The solution to this one is:

      BMM E.111 [1] ▶ ks.cycle('m2')
      Cycling amplifiers on m2 motor controller
      killing amplifiers
      reactivating amplifiers
      enabling motors</pre>

= Old System - Analog Switches =

There is a row of switches on rack D, the rack next to the control station, that are used to disable the amplifiers for the MCS8 motor controllers.

[[File:Kill switches.jpg|500px|Kill switches.jpg]]

This is useful in the situation where an amlpifier fault is preventing motion on one or more axes. The most common culprits of this situation are the jacks on the M2 and M3 mirrors (m2_yu, m2_ydo, m2_ydi, m3_yu, m3_ydo, m3_ydi).

When you suspect that a motor has an amplifier fault, toggle the appropriate switch to the off position.&nbsp; Wait 10 seconds (to be very safe...).&nbsp; Then toggle the switch back to the on position. The motor should be ready to go. These switches replace the shorted plugs that came attached to the "disable" port on the back side of the MCS8s.

In the situation where toggling the switch does not clear the amplifier fault, the next troubleshooting step is to power cycle the MCS8.&nbsp; This is done by toggling the red, illuminated switch on the front of the MCS8.&nbsp; Wait for the red amplifier lights to stop flickering after turning off the MCS8, then turn the MCS8 back on.

After power cycling the MCS8, it is '''necessary''' to re-home all the motors controlled by the MCS8.



= MCS8 Connector =

The disable plug on the back of the MCS8 controllers is a Binder RS connector, part number 468-885. [https://uk.rs-online.com/web/p/industrial-automation-circular-connectors/0468885/?sra=pstk Here's an example].

And here is the wiring diagram.&nbsp; Short the prongs on the opposite side of the alignment groove.
